# Intelligent-Recruitement-System
This is the first AI project I ever developed, It's about finding the candidates that fits better for a job offer.
We used machine learning and text mining techniques to analyse candidates' profiles and the job offer description and find the matchings.
Key words: 
  - Text mining
  - Natural Language Processing 
  - Document Embedding 
  - Machine Learning: Clustering
